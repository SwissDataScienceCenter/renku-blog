![Cloud storage access from Renku](./image_1.png)

Working with your data in Renku is faster and simpler: you can write and read your data from your external storage services, such as S3, Azure Blob or WebDAV among others.

RenkuLab interactive sessions can access data hosted in a cloud storage system, and the storage is simply mounted as another folder in your session. You can concentrate on developing your code to analyse your the data and share the results with your colleagues or even with the broader community.

The access to external storage can be configured via project settings. Check out Renku (documentation)[https://renku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to-guides/renkulab/external-storage.html] to configure cloud storage for your project.

If you use [SSH sessions via the CLI](https://blog.renkulab.io/ssh-sessions), you can use cloud storage there too. You just need to configure cloud storage for your project on RenkuLab.io, and those storages will be mounted in your remote session.
