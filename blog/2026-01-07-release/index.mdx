New in Renku this month: Better collaboration, broader support, and lasting research links!

<!-- truncate -->

Happy 2026, Renku community! 🚀

We hope you all had a refreshing break. While the year is just getting started,
the Renku team was busy through the end of 2025 wrapping up some impactful
features designed to make your collaborative research even smoother.

From better hardware support to more precise permission settings, here is a look
at what’s new in **Renku releases 2.10.0 through 2.12.0.**

---

### 💻 **Seamless Support for ARM Architectures**

If you are working on a modern Mac (Apple Silicon) or running heavy workloads on
HPC clusters like CSCS’s **Alps (Daint)**, you know that architecture matters.

We’ve now automated the image-building process for **arm64**. When configuring
your launcher, simply select the appropriate architecture, and Renku will
automatically build the correct image for you. To save you from troubleshooting
headaches, we’ve also added a warning if you attempt to launch an image on an
incompatible compute resource.

### 👥 **Finer-Grained Group Permissions**

We’ve refined how Group roles work to give you more control over your
collaborative spaces.

- **The Change:** Previously, Group Editors had full administrative reach over
  all projects within a group.
- **The New Way:** Group Editors can now add new projects to a group, but they
  **cannot** modify the settings of projects they don't personally own.
- **The Benefit:** This creates a clearer boundary for large teams, ensuring
  that only Project Owners and Group Owners can change critical project
  configurations.

### 🔌 **Smoother Repository Onboarding**

Many of you rely on our GitHub and GitLab integrations to keep your code in
sync. We heard your feedback that it wasn't always clear if an integration was
fully "active" until you were already inside a session—only to realize you
couldn't push your code.

Now, Renku provides a **clearer signal before you launch**. If an integration is
available but your credentials aren't linked, you'll see a prompt to connect
them first. This ensures you enter your session ready to work, with all the
permissions you need from the get-go.

### 🔗 **Preserving Your Research: Legacy GitLab Redirects**

With the shutdown of Renku’s legacy GitLab instance (`gitlab.renkulab.io`)
coming at the end of this month, we want to ensure your published work remains
accessible.

If you have moved a repository to a new home (like GitHub or our new GitLab
instance) and want to ensure old links—such as those in published papers—don't
break, we can help. Simply [**fill out this
form**](https://www.notion.so/2540df2efafc80a2bee5f1b7d247c28e?pvs=21) with your
new repository location, and we will automatically redirect visitors from the
old URL to the new one.

### **Full Release Notes**

While these are the highlights, there were many other smaller fixes and
performance tweaks in these releases. For the curious, you can find the full
technical breakdown on our [GitHub Releases
