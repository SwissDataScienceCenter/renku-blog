Renku has evolved considerably over the past several years; from our strong
initial focus on computational reproducibility to our current goals of building
connections within and across communities. As we engaged with various research
communities, we understood that one of the main struggles researchers face in
collaborative projects is consolidating a scattered collection of resources
across various providers, tools, and technologies.

We have therefore decided to refocus our efforts and (re)build the platform to
try and address this gap in the ecosystem. We envision Renku as a platform that
connects and enables data-centric projects from the ideation phase, through the
productive, results-oriented phase, all the way to dissemination and
publication. In the process, members of a project can bring together their data
sources, repositories and computational environments. A project’s assets can be
used and reused in other projects; they can be kept private, shared with team
members or with the more general public. In this way, we hope to create a
vibrant ecosystem of data and tools used to process, interpret, and understand
it.

We are calling this new iteration “Renku 2.0” even though Renku version 1.0 does
not currently exist! We want to imprint the idea that this is a new concept, not
just an evolution of the current one.

## Mix and match: code, data and compute

To enable flexible use cases, Renku 2.0 is based on modular project
configurations. Users can bootstrap their projects with a mix of code
repositories, data sources, and compute environments and evolve
them as the project matures. For example, in an early stage of a project, a data
scientist may simply require a quick way to connect a cloud compute environment
to a data source for some basic data exploration; as the analysis of the data
deepens, they may need to add a code repository to start versioning the code and
collaborate with others in a more structured way. Later on, someone else on the
project might build a containerized app or dashboard to demonstrate the data
properties and model results more easily with non-experts.

Renku 2.0 will allow you to select the components that you need for your project
to work. Beyond the current capabilities that Renku already offers, you can
leverage the flexibility of Renku 2.0 in multiple new situations, for example:

- If you are testing out RenkuLab... and you want to bring your **existing GitHub repo** into a project and start a compute session from **the docker image you have already defined**.
- If you are starting a new project... and you want to **initialize a git repository** and **start out with a basic compute environment**. Later, you will decide what data and storage you need.
- If you find an interesting dataset... and you want to **test it out in a live compute environment** so you can decide quickly if you want to move forward with it.
- If you are working on a project that uses **multiple repositories** from multiple collaborators... and you want to use all of them in 1 Renku project together.
- If you need to showcase your project... and you want to create a **dashboard that uses a different environment configuration than the development environment**.

A “Renku project” is where data science work gets done. For this, a few ingredients are required, namely:

- Data
- Code
- Compute Environment

Renku’s role is about making it easy for researchers to **mix and match** the elements they need to get their work done. In addition, Renku makes these elements **searchable**, encourages their **reuse** between projects, and **illuminates connections** between them (even across projects) wherever needed. Renku accomplishes this by extracting and indexing useful metadata about each of those elements.

### Data

Data science projects need data! Users can connect different types of cloud data
sources to their projects, such as S3 buckets and WebDAV resources. Projects
may also bring published data into the platform where it can be staged on fast
storage for more efficient processing. Data sources can be shared among
individuals, groups or communities to simplify reuse. The access to external
data sources is controlled by the 3rd party cloud storage provider.

### Code

In Renku 2.0, users can bring git repositories into their project not only from
the connected Renku-managed GitLab instance, but also from external GitLab
instances and GitHub! We encourage everyone to version their code, but if
the project does not require versioning (yet), you are not obligated to use it,
and you can start a Renku project with no code repository at all!

### Compute Environment

Renku 2.0 will continue offering the possibility to work in the cloud, where all
project resources are available for all collaborators. For quick, uncomplicated
data explorations, users will be able to start immediately from pre-configured
images, loaded with some standard libraries depending on the desired programming
language. In addition, users will be able to define their own environments to
use in compute sessions; these can be annotated and shared so members of a
community can benefit from each other’s efforts and use a consistent software
stack. Furthermore, we plan to allow users to connect their Renku projects to to
external compute resources (e.g. HPC or other cloud compute).

## UX Research

As we develop this new iteration of Renku, we rely on great feedback from our users
to make sure that we stay on the right track. If you are interested in having a say
how the project develops and contribute your thoughts to features that are in the pipeline,
please [drop us an email](mailto:hello@renku.io)!
