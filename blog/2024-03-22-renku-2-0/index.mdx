Renku 2.0 is about positioning Renku as a great **connector**, where researchers can easily bring together disparate resources. The main goal is to allow for modular project configurations.

Renku 2.0 will allow you to select the components that you need for your project to work. Beyond the current capabilities that Renku already offers, you can levereage the flexibility of Renku 2.0 in multiple situations, for example:

- If you are testing out RenkuLab... and you want to bring your **existing GitHub repo** into a project and start a compute session from **the docker image you have already defined**.
- If you are starting a new project... and you want to **initialize a git repository** and **start out with a basic compute environment**. Later, you will decide what data and storage you need.
- If you find an interesting dataset... and you want to **test it out in a live compute environment** so you can decide quickly if you want to move forward with it.
- If you are working on a project that uses **multiple repositories** from multiple collaborators... and you want to use all of them in 1 Renku project together.
- If you need to showcase my project... and you want to create a **dashboard that uses a different environment configuration than the development environment**.

A “Renku project” is where data science work gets done. For this, a few ingredients are required, nammely:

- Data
- Code
- Compute Environment

Renku’s role is about making it easy for researchers to **mix and match** the elements they need to get their work done. In addition, Renku makes these elements **searchable**, encourages their **reuse** between projects, and **illuminates connections** between them (even across Projects) wherever needed. Renku accomplishes this by extracting and indexing useful metadata about each of those elements.

### Data

Renku 2.0 supports working with both **cloud and local data sources**. However, access to external data sources is controlled by the 3rd party cloud storage provider.

In addition, given the broader adoption of open research data repositories, Renku 2.0 will offer import and export functionalities from/to data repositories.

Thus, Renku 2.0 will enable easier sharing and reusing data sources among people, projects, and groups.

### Code

Renku 2.0 will allow you to define multiple repositories per project, as needed. These code repositories can be created in different sources (e.g. GitHub, GitLab). Thus, the access to these code repositories governed by source provider, not by Renku.

### Compute Environment

Renku 2.0 will continue offering the possibility to work in the cloud, where all project resources are available for all collaborators. Thus, it will be possible to define resource pools for groups with high compute needs. Furthermore, Renku 2.0 will extend compute access to external resources (e.g. HPC or other cloud compute).

In addition, you will be able to (i) quickly start compute sessions in the cloud, (ii) define custom environments (e.g. libraries, languages), and, (iii) create multiple environments per project (e.g an environment for showcasing separate from development). Thuse, compute environments will be able to be reused by individuals or groups.
