### Why Renku 2.0?

Renku's mission has always been to support researchers by enabling collaboration, data
accessibility, and reusability. With Renku 2.0, we're taking this mission to the next level by
making it easier than ever to connect data, code, and compute resources into a seamless research
workflow.

In Renku 2.0, you can:

- **Connect your favorite tools and platforms.** Hook up your Renku project to GitHub repositories,
  external data sources, and more. Flexible integrations make collaboration easy and powerful.
- **Create 'Plug and Play' projects.** Mix and match code, data, and compute as needed to suit your
  project. You can link and reuse resources across multiple projects, too! The platform adapts to
  you, not the other way around.

### What's Coming Next?

We're working hard to bring you even more features as we prepare for the full **launch of Renku 2.0
in spring 2025**.

One of the key enhancements on the horizon is the ability to **customize your compute environment**.
In addition, we'll be making it easier to **migrate projects** into Renku 2.0.

Beyond that, we're planning integrations with data repositories, support for documentation and
metadata, and connections to external compute systems.
