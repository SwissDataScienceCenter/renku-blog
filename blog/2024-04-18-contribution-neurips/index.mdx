The Swiss Data Science Center presented Renku in the [37th Conference
on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023),
which took place on Dec. 10th to 16th 2023 in New Orleans (US).
The contribution “Renku: a platform for sustainable data science” presents
those Renku features that make it a unique platform to support sustainable
development and use of data and code, and showcases how Renku works in
different scientific domains.
