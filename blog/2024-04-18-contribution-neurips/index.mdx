The Swiss Data Science Center presented Renku in the [37th Conference
on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023),
which took place on Dec. 10th to 16th 2023 in New Orleans (US).
Our contribution [“Renku: a platform for sustainable data science”](https://papers.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/838694e9ab6b0a193b84daaafcac0eed-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf) presents
those Renku features that make it a unique platform to support sustainable
development and use of data and code, and showcases how Renku works in
different scientific domains.
